Idea of Africa
--------------

Is it an idea, or a concrete location?

Concrete, Africa is a continent completely surrounded by oceans. Africa is real, unlike in older times that most considered it an artificial construction. Africa is a realistic place.

### Philosophical realism

*"Contemporary philosophical realism is the belief that some aspects of reality are ontologically independent of our conceptual schemes, perceptions, linguistic practices, beliefs, etc. Realism may be spoken of with respect to other minds, the past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as natural numbers), moral categories, the material world, and thought. Realism can also be promoted in an unqualified sense, in which case it asserts the mind-independent existence of the world, as opposed to skepticism and solipsism. Philosophers who profess realism often claim that truth consists in a correspondence between cognitive representations and reality."*

Realism was once known as a philosophical idealism in ancient Greece, and Medival Europe - realism was considered a "rival" to philosophy. Perhaps, philosophical idealism might be better known as philosophical *"ideaism"* - as they were constructed with such.

*"Things exist because they fit in one of the categories we made up to contain such things."*

### Take some examples

Take the example of Pittsburgh, it existed because we have made up such an category as cities, which contains a collective settlement such as the City of Pittsburgh. Same goes for all of the "things" in the world.

Take the case of electrons, then. It did not exist just ~200 years ago - as we did not know about them, and neither do we have a name for them - let alone a category for such containment. Perhaps, ~200 years later, we might find that electrons are ridiculous product of scientific ignorance - like we consider the concept of aether (a substance in which matters, and light passes through...) from ~200 years ago, as ridiculous and ignorant.

*Things in a realist world comes and goes - and the existence of things purely depends on the human mind.*

### The origins of Africa

The idea of "Africa" originated from Europe, imagined as a collective whole (but not as a continent made up of countries, nations, clans, etc.).

Greek historian Herodotus reported that a group of Egyptians sailed/navigated around the continent of Africa. Portugese voyagers sailing around Africa established that Africa is indeed a continent in the 16th century - and thus creating a map for the continent in following voyages. But many others, European, Asian, and of course, Africans, knew the portion of Africa.

### The collective Africa

Africa was, and largely is, considered as a collective whole, but not portions.

### The portions of Africa

Ancient Greeks and Romans knew well about North Africa, and the Sahara Desert. The name of African probably originated from a word of Mediterranian seamen ([Phoenicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia)):

*"Afer" or "Afri".*

And later, to an extent, Africa was portioned to their knowledge... "Ethiopia" (or a similar word used by the Romans), and "Kongo" (note the "K"), etc. was mapped in early cartographics - south to Europe, and gated by Egypt, and to where we know as "Sub-saharan Africa" in contemporaries.

The identification of Africa
----------------------------

When did Africans start to identify themselves as Africans? And when, was Africa as where they lived in took hold?

Africans gradually developed a sense of the continental concept of Africa, like the Europeans charting Africa. History was often told, or implied upon in the first place. There was no such thing as Germany before Bismarck, teaching its people of a nation named Germany; similarly, no such thing as America, before they were identified. The case of Africa was certainly not unique in its identification.

### What was Africa?

Not until ~500 years ago, Europeans did not start to treat Africans with a sense of inequality. The imagination of locations never held great knowledge of by the Europeans driven themselves to the fantasies of Africa, and Africans - just as another place, and people of another place.

*Great dragons, fantastic creatures, and interesting stories...*

For that reason, Africa and Africans were never known as backwards and barbaric people before this point in time. Nothing but an interesting variant of people, yet another shade of human existence.

People might be surprised that Africans were often dipicted in European artwork back in 14-16th centuries - Africans were traders, travelers, slaves (of that particular period) - many even married into European families. There was no uglification and devilization, no intention by the artists.

*"This one, apparently from Africa."*

In terms of basic standard of living, there was no real difference between Europeans and Africans. Nearly all lived on land, life expectancy was low, healthcare was minimal - nearly none was well educated - on both continents.

There was no particular reason to look down on Africans back in the days.

### The "inferior continent"

Since ~500 years ago, Africans were increasingly dipicted as unsophisticated, non-Christian, uncomplex, uneducated... people - needing guidance and help, and the most of all, pity - some of the ideas came along the way to this very century.

*A continent was since despised by Europeans.*

Many of the educated Europeans knew of the portions of Africa, but with the coming of 1600, the differences and details were largely lost. Coming with the blurring was a stronger sense of despise and pity of this continent.

*How did they become the anti-Europe, and what made Europe great?*

Technology, life quality, education was rising rapidly in Europe, in comparison, there weren't much changes in Africa. The material gulf between Europe and Africa widened rapidly with all these.

As living standards rises in the age of Renaissance, the living standard of Africa became less of an interest, to the degree of ignorance in this period - to Europeans. They were since knonw as the inferior people, forming inferior continent.

### Trans-Atlantic slave trades

In the even of the 15th to 18th century, millions of Africans were taken from their own community and families to European colonies. Slavery existed, mind you, a long time before the trans-Atlantic slave trades (Greece) - however, nothing could quite match the trades of this period.

*Slavery, the Trans-Atlantic slave trades propelled the European countries and colonies to its prosperity today.*

Africans were isolated, in this process, from the "common humanity" - with irrelevant history.

### Eugenics and racism

With slave trades of over 3 centuries, the trades were increasingly justified with theories of biological inferiority - attributed to Africans, those bought and sold in the trades. This was a psychological comfort Europeans might had found in the period, of these inhumane institutions.

### Legacy

As long as the period of slave trades were past, in contemporary days, although collaboarations where made, the deep image of African inferiority brought by European racism still wasn't eradicated.

The question of race
--------------------

The idea of "race" were not nearly as clear as it is today (or much to the 19th century) back in the 1600s and 1700s. Although ideas of skin color differences were in existence during this particular period, and that the idea of race being immutable never changed since - biological properties was mixed with connections and imagination of their characteristics and personalities.

Also note that, the question of whether race could change with the change of environment was concerning - unlike today - to most Europeans by the time.

### Scientific racism

In the light of biological scicences, some biologists from European countries - say, Gobineau - were keen on learning the differences and scientific facts of races, and perhaps more interested on showing the superiority of Europeans and white races. Biological features thus was "scientifically justified" to be related to some of the negative circumstances and notions Africans hold - much like how we might have thought and imagined to this day.

With scientific theories, comes with the lesser form of such knowledge, as stereotypes. Those taken as valid from schools were and maybe, are in danger of such collusion between science and stereotypes.

The void
--------

The lack of knowledge of Africa and Africans, forming a void. A void could only be filled with knowledge - whether collected via science, media, commercial advertisement, or stereotypes and imagination.

*Why do we talk about Africa as a collective, rather than a collection of different peoples and cultures? Why are they still an "anti-us"?*

We have filled the void, over the time, with fear and uncertainties of this particular continent - the misknowledge of Africa still haunts us. However, it is equally important to know that the idea of Africa matters, being an idea to us, but realistically affects Africans with their lives, their images to themselves, and their own dignity.
