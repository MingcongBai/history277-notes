Public Healing and Politics in Pre-colonial Africa
--------------------------------------------------

### Public healing as concept and practice

The concept of public healing seems internally contradicting, the idea of "healing" often times refer to the relief of suffering, not usually as a collective body. The "healing" in pre-colonial Africa healed both physical bodies and political bodies.

The introduction of publiic healing originated from traditional views of illness in the Sub-Sahara Africa. Back then, there was broader definition (and in fact, two categories) for diagnosed illness - those illness of people, and those of the God - while illnesses of the God were events that happened, those of people were deliberated brought by... Say, the act of anti-social activies (like witchery by the time), was a kind of illness of people... Droughts that happened were often times not associated with human action (as they were inevitable at times), but at the same time associated with the acts by a group's enemy.

Illnesses of people was believed to be treated with medicines, and additionally "activated" with the speeches of healers. The idea of "medicine" was seen more like a provider of solution (reflection, relief, and experiences), but not limited to biological transformation that we believe medicines are responsible of. But all in all, these medicines targeting illnesses of people were believed to heal illnesses in physical and political/social bodies.

### The *Chwezi Kubandwa* revolution in the Great Lakes region

Often found in and arond the Great Lake region, known to be "travelling in between the common world and the underworld". Known as the brilliant peoples, a short dynasty of *Chwezi* emerged. These empires of the *Chwezi* was often portrayed with a "racial baggage", as the European explorers could not bring themselves to believe the complexity of the established empires in these regions - they imagined the *Chwezis* to be originated from elsewhere, anywhere but from Africa.

But over time, the *Chwezis* were accepted to be some of the earliest kings, forming kingdoms - instead, the question turned to the "who", and the question of their own origins. They concluded that they were immigrant groups with extrodinary abilities... While those skeptic believed that they were merely stories in traditional African cultures of the Great Lake region - instead, they concluded that these *Chwezis* were merely an oral tradition that described legendary kings and leaders...

... But some of the more popular thoughts is that the *Chwezis* were spirits that enters people's bodies. People of the Great Lakes region tend to believe that *Chwezis*, as spiritual forces could heal illnesses in people, including the question of infertility and the so-called evil deeds. People were thought to be spiritual mediums in which the spirits possessed - and one may become *Chwezi* himself as being possessed and overwhelmed by the very spirit of *Chwezi*.

Those embodied the spirits were therefore praised as healers, and those bringing fortune and cure, and perhaps more importantly, the *prevention of misfortune*.

### Differentiating *Chwezi* from other types of spirits

One important aspect in the differentiation was that *Chwezi* could take over anyone's body... whose body properly initiated for embodiment (or as medium) - also, anywhere, *Chwezi* was a spirit that was not limited to a specific locale. Mediums/Embodiments (often times women) of these spirits, they carry the *Chwezi* spirit with them, therefore, expanding the range "blessed" by this kind of spirit.

There's a common believe that one's soul continued to exist after death, and resides in the underworld as anscestral ghosts - and thus making appearances on Earth - and given that there is a living heir to take care of the ghosts (offerings in shrines, paying tributes, etc.). Those not so fortunate, were eternally "stuck" in the underworld. But *Chwezis* could come up to the Earth by a "pull" of initiated mediums, without the need of blood bounds.

### Situatin the *Chwezi* within a larger regional narrative

How could this kind of "intellectual innovation" be attractive... Given the differentiation, probably those childless/infertile (note that they are not equivalent, say, one may give birth to a child, but doesn't necessarily have control over their own child - given a marginalised status, and their child adopted) people, who emphasized on a question of being "remembered", and its existence on Earth.

### In conclusion

"Healing skills" were of the center of political, economical, and social factors in pre-colonial Africa. The "healings" to be provided by specific healers gained respect and political power in certain areas - but also in some cases, those in power could feel threatened, and also, often times felt obliged, to gain alliance with these healers. Those powers to heal, couldn't help to become involved in political processes, with the intention to help, and control those subjects.

It is also essential to not ignore the reality of wealth-in-people in early African societies, those who gathers the most are known to be those of the most powerful and influential.
