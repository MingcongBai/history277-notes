How Colonialism Ended
---------------------

When talking about end of colonialism and establishment of independent nations, it is important to note the choice of words when describing these events - did they "win" it, or were they "given" it? This is a question of relation in power between the Africans and their colonisers.

It is also worth considering, what does "independent" mean, and what does it involve? Is it defined with the shift in power ownership, or does it come with any other meanings (independent in military, economic, and administration support). Does it mean a departure from foreign humanitarian supports? In what cases shall a nation be recognised as reliant, or vice versa...

Was independence given to nations as a collective, to independence fighters and political elites, or those educated and rich?

### Growing African Participation in Colonialism (1920 - 1930)

In the 1920s and the 1930s there were growing anticipation and sentiment for colonial rules to serve in favour of the Africans, and de-colonisation became a relevant topic to many Africans. After World War I - with the international climate of "self-determination" ideologies - a generation of educated Africans began organizing various African nationalist groups.

They began to question the idea of colonisation. Africans fought in the World War I alongside their European colonisers - some war event spread to the African continent - with the influence of democracy and self-determination ideals by the Europeans, the question quickly took momentum in African societies. However, in the context of the Great Depression in the United States and Europe, colonisers had little, if any interest in the topic of reforms in colonial governments.

Also happened in these two decades was the mass migration of Africans to the urban areas to labour in industrial sectors - and thus gave birth to labour leagues and movements in Africa. In the contrast of European and United States labour movements gave Africans the right to question exploitation - and the fact that they were exploited much further than the Europeans and Americans. This, in turn served as a factor of destabilisation in the African societies.

Those Africans educated or even studied in Europe increasingly felt the urge to gain independence. The European rhetorics of democracy and independence gave them a hint of expectation that their generation could access these ideals and implement this change to their own societies.

### The Beginning of the End (1940 - 1950)

The World War II war efforts, allied and axis alike, demanded resources - 50% of gold were mined in Africa, and states needed gold in their national reserve to pay for the war; 25% of magnesium were found in Africa (steel production); 40% of chrome were found in Africa (frames, etc.); 25% of vanadium were found in Africa (steel production); ...; 98% of industrial diamond (cutter); 100% of uranium (atomic weaponaries)... With this surge in demand for mined resources, came the surge in demand for skilled workers and supervisors - with Europeans swamped in the war effort, Africans for the first time were allowed in supervising positions in these sectors of industry.

Britain and French were expected to be defeated by Germany in 1941 and 1942, and this reflected their own vulnerabilities as European nations and African colonies' rulers. Despite that, Africans were still drafted to the World War II to fight for the British and French army, and countless gave their lives to the war efforts.

The experience in fighting along side the Europeans and Americans on various continents told the soldiers that they were as much as humans as their colonial rulers - little distinctions were found in their experiences... And this, brought to the questioning that they could gain independence from those who were just as well as their own.

Self-determination became a practical ideology in African societies. With the Atlantic Charter signed by the allies, little consideration was given to their colonies - while educated Africans pushed for their own sovereignity. With economies plunging in the European countries - just as poor as their African counterparts in the late 1940s - led to a lost in taste for empires of extensive territories, and imperialism.

Worse for the Europeans yet, the idea of self-maintaining of the African colonies went under public questioning - and with that, so was the idea of civil mission for Africans, which came under heavy questioning and attacks as well - Christian value's association with colonies, just as heavily, was questioned.

*Is the colonial effort worth it?*

#### A Shift in Purpose

Late 1940s and early 1950s, colonial governments shifted to development to the colonies - despite the divide in their home nations and political parties - to bring *modernity* to Africa. This was also questioned by African intellectuals, and they rejected this idea.

### French System (a.k.a. Direct Rule)

In French colonies, there was extensive control from the French government and parliament, little power and representation were given to local governments. As to the questions of civil involvement, it was minimal.

In independence struggles, the question of independence to the French, were national issues (to both the colonies and France itself) - as opposed to the locality in British colonies. In other words, in French colonies, independence usually comes top-down, as opposed to the grassroot origins of British colonial independence movements.

#### Blaise Diagne

In 1914, he was the first black African elected to the French National Assembly - in a demand that Senegal may no longer be represented by white Europeans. Further, he demanded French citizenship to colonial subjects - which French suggested four major cities which got granted this priviledge (*Blaise Diagne Law of 1916*). During his term, he continued to advocate for citizenship rights in Senegal, but gave up against French pressure.

Note that he did not really push for national independence, but instead, pushed for civil rights under the framework of French colonial rules.

#### Lamine Gueye

Elected to the French National Assembly in 1946, where he pushed for citizenship to *all* French colonies overseas - which the National Assembly granted in the concern that repressing this demand may lead to disintegration of French colonies.

By mid-to-late-1950s, rights to election was given to French colonies that they could either choose independence, or retain connection with Paris and act as citizens of France. Gueye took independence, and Senegal thus gain independence without conflict or argument (1960).

### British System (a.k.a. Indirect Rule)

#### Julius Nyerere

Julius Nyerere of Tanzania was educated in the University of Edinborough, of political ideals of civil equality... He became the first president of Tanzania (or its then counterpart) in 1961/62/64. He demanded Tanzanian farmers to be able to work as they used to, and on top of that, bringing in a ruling class to govern the nation. Nyerere struggled to set up a minimal national welfare and "safety nets" in Tanzania.

It was not until 1962 that he became the Prime Minister in Tanzania, without any aid of foreign advisors. Then in 1964, he became the leader of a unified Tanzania (research...!).

### Negritude and Pan-Africanism

#### Leopold Senghor and Negritude

A intellectual, artist, and a politician of Senegal, he advocated for the celebration of Afriacn art, culture, heritages, and their own identities - which was relatively less political and revolutionary as compared to other African ideals in the continent.

With his resignation in 1980s, multi-party elections were since held in Senegal.

#### Kwame Nkrumah and Pan-Africanism

Emphasized for independence and separation from the colonisers in his political career in Ghana - a nationalist movement. Pan-Africanism expresses that Africans of the world has a common history of oppression and slavery, and that they hold a common destiny of freedom and independence.

Kwame Nkrumah also negotiated with the British for de-colonisation, and refused a practice governor in Ghana.

As a socialist politician, his ideal did not work out in his career as Premier of Ghana. A military coup took place in Ghana. However, he was regarded as a great visionary in Africa, who actively negotiated with colonisers and transformed colonies in relative swiftness and peace.

### Armed Struggle

#### Ahmed ben Bella (Algeria, 1954 - 1962)

One of the first armed struggles for independence in Africa - from France. French was already engulfed in the war in Vietnam, and then came the armed struggle in Algeria - a long, bloody war...

The war was significant for its revealing nature that human bombs were used by Algerians, and tortures were put against the Algerian revolutionaries.

- Movie, "Battle of Algeria".

#### Mau-Mau Rebellion (Kenya, 1952 - 1960)

British soldiers, along with British collaborators worked together to eliminate a nationalist group of Mau-Maus in Kenya. Mau-Maus fought back in a bloody fashion in an attempt to remove British settlers and their Kenyan collaborators from Kenya...

This rebellion was still highly argued among historians to this day.

### Non-violent

As mentioned above, Ghana.

### Last Hold-outs

All these last colonies in Africa were all under Portugal, with little intent to remove themselves from Africa - despite their tanking economy in Portugal. They were essentially forced out, however, they attempted to destroy infrastructures set in by themselves since the beginning of Portuguese colonial rules...

... With their disruptive fashion on leaving, nations were split into contemporary countries in armed struggles and full-scale wars - even proxy wars, for example, Soviet and Cuba involvement in Angola.

The bloodshed did not end completely until late 1990s.

- Angola (1961 - 1974).
- Monzambique (1964 - 1974).
- Zimbabwe (1965 and 1980).
- Namibia (1990).

### Side Notes

- Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain independence.
- Events of independence happened mainly in the decade of 1960s.
