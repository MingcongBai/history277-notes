South of Africa has been in contact with Europeans since the 1500s, especially for its abundance in gold and minerals - and of course, agricultural resources and open landscape. In the colonial era, British, along with religious refugees and German settlers colonised the south of Africa (the Cape area).

Born the Union
--------------

While wars against the Orange Free States ending in 1902, a unified South Africa was formed. With economics and governance looking ideal to the British colonisers, South Africa gained dominion status - significant degree of autonomy, but remained a member of the British Empire - forming the Union of South Africa.

Foundation of Apartheid
-----------------------

One of the laws or acts that established the foundation for Apartheid was the *colour bar*. The law was not originally intended for racial segregation, but for classification of professional workers and managers from the labours - a system of qualifications, and a class separation of working population. However, race and social classes played a part in the separation...

Some educated (black) Africans noticed the implication, and questioned the voting rights and equality in South African society. These people protested the Union of South Africa, and attempted to replace the British government - forming the South Africa National Congress. British colonisers used the Africanas in the North as an excuse to strip black Africans of their voting and employment rights.

Then comes the Lands Act, which stripped land ownership from the Africans by specifying that land must by owned for leased by white settlers. With the enactment, Africans had to migrate into large cities and urban areas for employment, and mostly in mining businesses.

Lands Act was followed by the Urban Act, which specified who may enter larger cities...

Individual movement, residence, and employment were therefore limited for economical purposes - topped off with the Imorality Act which further limited social and sexual interactions between races.

1948 Election of National Party
-------------------------------

A party which supported separation of races, led by Africanas. This, is the formal beginning of Apartheid. **Apartheid is a separation and segregation of races for the purposes of economical and political discrimination guided by White Supremacy and the emphasis on economical and political powers (and that they should be left for white people).** This was a systemic framework in the society of South Africa, which lasted to the 70s and some parts of the 80s.

Petty Apartheid and Grand Apartheid
-----------------------------------

Petty Apartheid was an institute which limits individual actions and interactions - mostly expressed in racial segregation in public instruments - a framework of legislation applied on individuals.

Grand Apartheid then, was a great institutional which promoted segragation. One of the most important example was the Population Registration Act, where race and classifications were made and recorded for governmental interests - white, black, mixed races... But *not limited to race*, this is a more generalised "eugenic" and physical distinction between people. Followed with the Natives Act, for anyone who's not Europeans must bring a Passbook at all times - recording name, racial and classifications, employment, and reasons for travel.

Further followed by the Bantu Education Act, which specified limited education to non-white individuals, but must be "consistent with their intellectual limits"... Of course, based on racial stereotypes on intellectualism. Furthermore, Group Areas Act which separated allowance areas of residence based on race or languages...

*A complete disconnection between different peoples in South Africa.*

1955 Freedom Charter
--------------------

Promoted equality, freedom, and democracy regardless of racial classification. However, the government at this point decided to remove political opposition - although voting rights were stripped from most non-whites since the establishment of Union. A series of mass arrest were put in against Freedom Charter without trial or specific charges.

Nelson Mandela of African National Congress was enraged and lost faith in peaceful opposition and protests for changes, he suggested "selective sabotage" - to create disruption in African society. The government in turn dealt with the new "sabotages" with extreme violence, see [Sharpeville Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpeville_massacre).

Nelson Mandela was later arrested and convicted in the Treason Trial and brought to a prison on the Robin Island - not released until the 1990s (27 years) - and his image was banned and censored during his imprisonment.

Black Consciousness Period
--------------------------

Increased coersion by the colonial government brought black consciousness activists to radical measures, along with raising consciousness in African nationalism.

Bantustans
----------

Africans were relocated to their "homelands", in which case they were no longer citizens of South Africa, but allowed into South Africa for work - with constant migration, the government hoped to control labour force and formation of leagues. Moreover, the worst areas were assigned for the purposes of Bantustans...

Soweto Uprising
---------------

With Afrikaan set in as the official language by the National Party, young students of the township of Soweto, where students demonstrated against this decision. The protest was ruthlessly suppressed with use of tank and missiles. Large amount of students were killed in this event.

This event brought in attention in the international community.

Expenses and Collapse
---------------------

The running of the Apartheid became increasingly expensive with extensive administration and police deployment - added with the international pressure - Apartheid began its phase of collapse.

With difficulties in maintenance of the Apartheid, the government decided to create parliaments (with appointed members) for white, colored, and Africans. Black Africans realised little commitment to this proposal - knowing that this is merely a image fixing measure and served little more than divide and conquer. African nationalist parties took to the streets and protested **violently** against government, police, and military targets. State of emergency was set in for 1984 and 1985, the government took over using police and military - a martial law.

With tanking economy, international pressure, and difficulties in governing. Apartheid terms were then renegotiated. As a last stray effort to maintain Apartheid, the government suggested differences and potential issues brought in by the Xhosas and Zulus - as ANC may follow the National Party to rule South Africa - but it was later found out that conflicts between these two ethnic groups were encouraged and funded by the National Party ("Third Hand of Violence").

Unbanning of oppositon was then put in place. First democratic election with no racial discrimination was held in 1994.

Truth and Reconciliation Hearings (1995-2005)
---------------------------------------------

Questioning and research needed.
