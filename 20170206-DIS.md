Hamites and Nilo-Hamites?
-------------------------

Referring to a language/ethnic group found around North Africa, and the Horn (East) of Africa. While being a religious reference to a figure named Ham, whose doing was deemed unpure by the God, was damned ([Curse of Ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham)) with a darker toned skin.

Given the physical appearance of the Africans that the Europeans encountered in earlier times, they, with the darker skin tone, was deemed to be connected to the figure of Ham - therefore they were unpure and backward. But all in all, much of a stereotype implied on black Africans.

---------------------

An important theme in archaeology is the question of creation, maintenance, and the iterations of power. Also, the concepts related to this theme:

- Ideology.
- Economy.
- Military.

At the same time, classical concepts of powers could either be a rigid "hierarchical" system, or a de-centralised "network" of people (or heterarchy) - in other words, either via command and executive orders, or via negotiation and collaboration...

### Case study: the Massai herders

The Massai Herders were a group of cattle herders, therefore could be classified as a pastoral society. On the question of ideology, their faith involves two Gods:

- Engai Narok, or Black God, who is benevolent.
- Engai na-Nyokie, or Red God, who is vengeful.

Which characterises tehm with a strong emphasis on militarism and warriorship. They believed that in order for one to become a man, thus a warrior, they must be circumcised - and men were expected not to cry during the process. Expansionism is a prominent character of this group of people.

Economics of this group was centralised around their cattles, and the merging of groups of other people during their pastoral migration.

The Massais were defeated in the late 19th century by the European settlers, which resulted in a treaty that stripped away 40% of their land. And they were known to be fought against by the previous groups of people who they defeated before, who formed allies with the Europeans.
