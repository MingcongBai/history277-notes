The End of Slavery
------------------

### Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade

The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade was the longest, and largest scale coverse movement of people in the history of humanity - involving a large amount of Africans and Native Americans. A key question involved with European's involvement in the slavery is that, why weren't the Native Americans used as the primary source of workforce? Recall from the earlier stages of the discovery of the New World, the Native Americans were either massacred in war of conquests, forced labour, or brought down by foreign diseases imported from Europe.

Ever four Africans moved to the New World were accompanied with one European - on the question of gender ratio however, four out of five women moved to the New World were African.

#### Why not anyone else?

With the decline of Native American population, labour from Africa formed the basis of exploitation for goods consumed around the world - gold, sugar (most important of all), diamonds, and other luxurious goods. The production and plantation of sugar characterised the migration pattern of African slaves - the Deep American South, the Carribeans, and especially Brazil saw the largest amount of incoming African slaves for this very reason.

#### International interactions

The interactions between Europeans and Africans since the 16th century had been slavery. One might question that why Africans were used instead of European, in the context of a labour shortage in the Americas? Europe has a long history of slavery, and usually one would find a similar pattern to that of pre-colonial Africa, a mixture of groups of people who were marginalised in the society. European's initial expansion to the New World generally cluttered around the tropical and sub-tropical areas. Free or indentured European labours travelled across for production of plantations - albeit only convicts and debters were sent by force to the New World - there simply weren't enough labour for the output of products demanded by the time. They then turned to slavery for an expansion in labour forces.

#### Market protection and its shift

In the second half of the 18th century, six European powers eseentially controlled the whole of Atlantic slave trade - all built upon the foundation of slavery. They all had created trade barriers, in which they shared the variety of products, but were controlled to only sell to their own markets. The need for sugar essentially filled the demand, so that people were compelled to enslave others with inhumane treatments - most notably in the Middle Passage. Maze, sugar canes, rice... were vice crops.

It is also important to know that the strength of navy was the key to the amount and range of enslavement - the Britain and Portuguese, being the strongest on the seas, some 7 out of 10 slaves transported across the Atlantic Ocean were transported either to Brazil or British Americas.

In late 16th century and the early 17th century, plantations were scattered around the Americas to be sold to their own markets. In the latter part of the 17th century and into the 18th century, the allowance of sending product to a freer market (across barriers) - six of the slave trading empires were truncated to three: Brazil, Cuba, and the United States. Intense specialisation also resulted in a shift in American plantations: e.g. cottons for the United States, sugar for Cuba, and coffee for Brazil.

Interestingly, by the 1850s and afterwards, there were only two places where slaves were disembarking, Cuba and Brazil - while slaves died in around 5 to 10 years in these areas, slaves tended to live a bit longer in the United States, so long as they could reproduce - there was simply no need for slave import.

#### Slave trades and its migration in Africa

The great human and environment diversity in Africa made examining the African slave trades as a whole impossible - nor did they end at the same time, or at the same degree. The centers of slave trades tended to shift from the North (around Senegal) to the North (Angola and The Congo). Declines, and growth - and the demographic changes along with it - were felt differently, and during different periods. Stretching the timeline, slaves could be bought and sold at virtually every point on the West Coast (and later even to the East Coast, from the Cape of Good Hope, and to the North again).

### The decline of slavery

#### Abolitionism

By the late 18th to some time around the 19th century, slaves were officially abolished in most of the slave-trading nations. During around 3 decades, the nations involved has finished the official outlaw slavery and the force migration involved - which existed over three and a half centuries! The relatively rapid abolishment of slavery was generally believed to be related to ideological, economical, and religious changes took place in the western world - of which relative importance were still argued today. Some argued that the ideal of abolitionism was originated from the Enlightenment, in which people believed that men, and to a very small degree for women, held liberty and the right of being humen - which the slave trades had obviously violated. The question of the definition of a human were beginning to be thought of and asked during the Enlightenment period, asking this question resulted in the realization of Africans being human - just like themselves - also born in this period is the concept of *Humanity*, incorporating all human around the world, and the interest in aiding others (paternalism) of lesser advanced degree than Europeans and Europeans in the Americas. Still, the idea of *Humanitarianism* still held a hint of inequality in regards. And looking back, treating the slaves "humanely" could only mean the liberation of them. Humanitarianism was regarded as a sense of "Christian lover for their fellow human beings".

Side note: while some may argue about the economical factors involved in the abolition movement, it was found not to be true - slave trades were profitable to the end.

#### Calling for the end of slavery in the United States

With the slave trades outlawed in the United States, religious and propaganda-like activities were conducted (mostly Evangelical circus) - for which ex-slaves travelled around the nation to share their own experience as slaves - forming a certain degree of anti-slavery sentiment.

In the North, without the need for slaves on the farms, some began to suggest the end to slavery in the United States altogether. While those in the South owning plantations opposed, they agreed with the abolition of Atlantic Slave Trade - for a better image internationally - while began to conduct trades domestically, as there were enought slaves already.

#### Later illegal slave trade and its suppression

Slave trades across the Atlantic Ocean were still held after the official outlaw, mostly around the Southwestern Coast, and some Eastern Coast, north to Mozambique. Slaves were still brought from the inland to those Europeans living on the coasts. Measures were taken by coastal patrol who effectively bought the slaves from the ships - while the traders calculated their risk and reward, and ultimately further encouraged the illegal slave trades.

The illegal slave trades were not effectively suppressed until the governments started to impose public opinions on the slave trade - against its interest. However, later, official oppression was put in place, especially in Brazil and Cuba - effectively ended the slave trades altogether.

By the 1850s, slave trades across the Atlantic Ocean were despised by public and announced to be suppressed. The British Royal Navy committed ~10% of its personnels for the purpose of suppression - while before this period the British were found to be one of the largest figures in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, this really does reflect a shift in ideology that made this rapid transformation possible.

### Who is eligible to be enslaved?

Or who could be enslaved. Prior to the 13th century, it was accepted for Europeans to enslave other Europeans - much like in the Africa continent. By the time of Columbus' discovery, it became unacceptable for Europeans to enslave other Europeans - however, given the great diversity of human population in Africa, those disconnected were still subject to enslavement.

This still involves the idea of Africa, and similarly, the idea of Europe. Europeans started forming an idea of being "European", which prohibited the practice of enslaving each other. All in all, pan-Europeanism and pan-Africanism encouraged the abolition and marginalization of slavery in these areas - internally.

But Europeans could go on and trade African slaves, as they still don't belong to their own group - for another four centuries. The central factor of the rise and fall of the slave trades involves the question of eligibility - a line seldom crossed by even the most radical of the slave traders.

### The end of slavery

The end of slavery, as mentioned above, was brought by internationally cooperated suppression and legal actions. However this is only the aspect of the Europeans. In Africa, slaves were still brought by certain groups from the inland to the coasts, without a mean - not even illegally - to sell the slaves, they eventually got absorbed into the coastline as new slaves for African themselves. Also notably is the Arabic Slave Trade, which was not influenced by the abolitionist movement, at least for several decades.

With the end of slavery in Africa, African politics were destabilised. Warfares frequently broke out to take over local powers who heavily involved in the trades - which no longer existed. Political power shifted in great extents, until the eventual partition and colonization by the Europeans in the coming decades.

Legitimate commerce were also established with the end of slavery - palm oil, especially, used to lubricate industrial machineries - those African elites formulating the trades formed the new wave of commercial growth, and new threats to local political orders - more conflicts. Europeans also played a part in the conflicts, guns and new technologies were provided to favourable African groups, further destroying the balance of power in Africa.

And thus, future conflicts and colonization... Much to come later in the 20th century (and the "Scramble").
