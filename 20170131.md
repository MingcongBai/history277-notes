Pre-Colonial Africa
-------------------

*"The concept of 'Pre-colonial Africa' is absurd..."*

Human, *Homo sapien* emerged in Africa. Back in the 1800s, the Europeans conquered much of the Africa continent for over one century. The concept of African epochs, currently, is divided into three parts:

- Post-colonial Era (~50 years ago).
- Colonial Era.
- Pre-colonial Era (~200 years ago, to 1/4 million years ago, at the dawn of humanity).

The concept of pre-colonial era for Africa removes the details from the long human and cultural development in Africa. The concept is absurd in the way that it basically condenses what is known as the history of humanity... into a simple concept known as the pre-colonial era.

Social and political developmet of pre-colonial Africa
------------------------------------------------------

### Hunting and Gathering Societies

Hunting and gathering, a structured lifestyle for human living was the initial form of human livings. Not until ~12,000 years ago had human gradually given up this kind of lifestyle, and started tending crops - into agricultural era of humanity.

Hunting and gathering society has the properties of being built up from small groups of human beings, and was known to be very egalitarians - as in the nature of this lifestyle requires sharing and full, and unconditional co-operation. And this, for the longest time, was the best lifestyle geared towards survival.

But the issue of this kind of society was exactly from the gathering of materials... As we know hunting and gathering societies were small in scale - it doesn't quite make sense to vastly gather materials - thus no need for social hierarchies.

#### Social hierarchies

The introduction of social hierarchies was brought by the accumulation of materials, hierarchies was needed for the protection of one's possession - and consequently, the advantages one may hold over others.

Also brought in by this concept in a society, was the co-operation based on roles. Say, men, who generally had larger strength in hunting activties, therefore assigned for hunting. Women, then, were generally assigned for lighter tasks - picking plants that were edible. And those having difficulties when walking, were set to perform child-care occupations. Those weaker few was helped in the events of moving - as they had an expertise that could be vital for a group's survival.

As in such arrangement... There wasn't any form of political organization, as "bands" of people was the foundation, and at the same time, it was the basic form of these societies - and all they needed for such kind of organization.

#### Growth of societies

Let's say, we have a large lake somewhere with a great abundance of fish. There might be more and more people gathered around this area, for larger hopes of survival and more stable lifestyles.

The growth of societies brought by larger scale hierarchies, and those were found to be more rigid.

### Pastoral societies

Somewhere around 10,000 to 7,000 years, people in Africa, and in other regions found ways to domesticate animals, living off the animals' products - which constitutes the introduction of agriculture to human societies. This change removed the burden of having to travel and gather materials, those in pastoral societies for the first time, had a stable living place and a concept of home.

*But do note that this new lifestyle/society was introduced gradually.*

In pastoral societies, people still moved around periodically, for their domesticated animals would run out of food to eat, or a drought may happen in a specific region. However, this kind of societies worked the best in the two kinds of savannahs in Africa - animals lived off the grass, which is in abundance during the rainy seasons...

These societies thrives in the rainy season for the abundance of grass, while in the dry seasons, the societies would disperse, in order to decrease the demand for food and material in a given amount of area, and to travel more easily to farther distances - where potentially, there could be better chances of survival. But again, *in the events of rainy seasons, people would go back (gather) in a place called "homebase", where events were splendid in rainy seasons*.

With the growth of the groups of a specific homebase, a sense of belonging developed among the pastoralists - as they would realize that they belonged to the same group, for themselves being ascenstors of a common group of people - or from the same homebase. The concept of kinship was therefore introduced to people in Africa - a segmented political system.

### Segmented political system

Let's say we have group of people from the *X-homebase*, and all people from that specific homebase identifies themselves as *X-ish*. Over time, age groups started to diversify within the group. The senior person of this homebase would be identified as the central branch of the lineage - who has absolute authority over the group - much like families, even today's families, especially more extensive families.

In an event of dispersion during the dry seasons, the head of the lineage... again, often times the senior person of the kinship, would decide specific destinations for specific groups of people. As people (of sub-groups, sub-kinships) travel during the dry seasons, the groups themselves have their own leaders - with more or less the same principle of authority. And sub-groups divides when needs emerge for them to disperse even more during these seasons...

A segmented political system looks roughly like a pyramid...

```
          *
        *   *
      *   *   *
    *   *   *   *
  *   *   *   *   *
*   *   *   *   *   *
```

And notice the base only gets bigger as a group grows. But the principle is that people of lower social/political hierarchy submits (or in events, paying tributes) to those higher, and goes all the way to the tip of the pyramid structure. At this point, one should notice that there is less egalitarism in such kind of societies than the primal hunter and gathering societies. Gender roles, however, we could only assume now that it stayed more or less the same as they did in the hunter and gathering societies... No concrete evidence was yet found in regard to this issue.

When the Europeans arrived in the Africa continent, they were not quite familiar with the society structure that Africans still practice. They were not completely foreign to this idea, however, the concept was found originally found in the Old Testament - in Israel. The lineages were consequently identified by the Europeans as tribes - based on the differences in languages and cultures.

But note that, in early pastoral societies, this form of social and political arrangement was found elsewhere - in agricultural societies, especially in Africa - for more or less the same reason, from more or less the same circumstances.

### The case of an agricultural society

Agricultural societies have a similar concept of homebase and dispersion, but the process of dispersion happened in a significantly slower pace, and more importantly, with different motives. Let's say a village of agricultural settlement gets too big over a long time (for obvious reasons), the chief of the village may suggest that a group of younger people move away and create a new village... Or alternatively, a group of people was not tolerated within a village, they could be exiled or just suggested to leave, and consequently creating a new village.

But after all, all villages pay tributes to their "homebase" village, for the chief of them all. However, there wasn't a rigid borderline, no central government, and no tax schemes was to be found in such kinds of society-spawned-by-society movements. After all, villages had significantly varied political systems from within, but more or less in the same segmented fashion as found with pastoral societies. *There were exceptions, too.*

To be expected, however, Europeans called these groups tribes as well... But holding different names... As linguistics and cultural varies from the derivation of groups of people, but holding a common ancenstor.

### Pre-colonial African Empires

In certain regions of Africa, the rapid accumulation of materials, as a way for the protection and organization of materials, empires with kings, armies, and civil servants were built - into empires. Often found from shores of the Nile River to the Mediterranian Sea. The most famous one among them all is probably the empire of Egypt - and in fact, one of the earliest - often regarded as the cradle of civilization. Several dynasties was iterated in these empires...

In these empires, writing systems, majestic cities were found. Empires existed from ~7,000 years, all the way to the modern era... And the rest was just the news we see.

*An interesting observation from a map of Pre-colonial African empires, there were overlapses of territories among these empires.*

#### Why then, were empires only found in some regions?

There was not concrete evidence as of yet, but there are two conditions to be met (or at least the first one should be met):

- Strategic commercial zones, a large sum of money could be made from thoughtfully organized trades - especially international trades (shores of the Mediterranian Sea, south to the Sahara Desert) - and this is especially favoured by governmental organizations, as money could be made collectively via tax schemes.
  - Some empires and states south to the Sahara Desert started to decline with the arrival of the Europeans in the 17th century, as boats were found to be a more convenient choice to carry goods and slaves than caravans.
- Introduction of religions. Political organizations, as ordered by foreign religion organizations, started to impose religious practices to people around them - thus creating states centralized around one or more religious faith. But note that only with the satisfaction of the first condition, thus relatively convenient traffic and traders allowed for the introduction of foreign religious faiths.
