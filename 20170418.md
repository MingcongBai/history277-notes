Youth, a complicated term
-------------------------

The idea of youth fills the gap between being children and becoming adult - in legal sense and in traditional legal regimes, there are laws for children and those for adults. We consider the transitional period between the two stages as youth. In Western conceptions, childhood stood for the period of limited responsibilties, freedom, and parental protection. For adults, it is a "magic" age from which responsibilities started to be applied upon an individual - moreover, with international legal systems dependent on adult or child status, the transition is often harsh.

*The stages of individual growth, then, could vary depending on the cultural or political context - and of course, historical periods.*

Age of Majority
---------------

The age of majority in most places in the world is 18, however, this age could change for the purpose of prosecution or political convenience. For example, in Sierra Leone, child soldiers of ages 15 and above were suggested to be prosecuted - in consideration of average age and majority age group by the prosecutors (who were from the United States) - even though it was officially endorsed that the age of majority in Sierra Leone was 18.

- The United Nations suggested the age range of 15-24 or 15-29 as the stage of youth - depending on the context.
- The African Union suggested the age range of 15-35 as youth.

To national builders - aid agencies or the governments - refer Youth specifically to "men" or "boys". Women on the other hand were categroized as "women under development" or "gender issues" - women who gave birth to a child will no longer be considered as youth - while men could still be considered as youth as long as they fit in the age criterion.

For our purpose, we consider youth a young person with tenuous social status and a hope for social transformation into adulthood. Adult by age or status are different concepts - ability to acquire resources that allows one to be considered or live like adult - that is, being self-sufficient, with established residence and stable finance (note the possible social class implications...).

Young Population, and the "Youth Bulge"
---------------------------------------

According to the African Union in 2014, more than 64% of sub-Saharan Africa were of ages under 35, and 35% were of ages between 15 to 35 - it was also predicted that in 2020 ~75% of sub-Saharan population will be of ages averaging 20. This reflects the demographic transition from high-stable to the "young bulge" state.

Why should we be concerned? To some, this is an economic issue, and to some others, a poltiical issue... What are the implications of a younger population on family building, social norms, and cultural traditions? The shift in population ages become an opportunity and a risk on these transformations - and to the young people themselves, it is up to them to struggle or challenge current circumstances. These changes could provide opportunity for legitimate wealth generation, or criminal activities (see "I Do Not Come to You By Chance").

It is stated by the African Union this year that 2017 is the "Year of Investment in Youth", for improved employment, empowerment, reproductive rights, etc. However, distrusts existed among African youth for the delayed action by the government to improve their quality of life. Most international development agencies paid great attention to primary education, resulted in ~75% of African children attend primary schools - however, the number dropped to ~30% for secondary schools, and 5-6% for college and professional training institutions (those qualified *and* capable of attending).

Then we come back to the problem of self-sufficiency... Employment as it stands now in Africa is in a state of under-employment, while some worked in formal jobs, and many worked in informal sectors - vending cigarettes, short-term jobs, etc. For 2014, Malawi has an unemployment rate of 6%, but 70% among young people; Kenya, 10% for general unemployment, and 35% for young people; Nigeria, 9% for general, 30% for young people; Senegal, 10% for general, 70% for young women, 35% for college graduates; Namibia, South Africa, etc. hold similar figures. Young people struggled to establish economic indepenence and family construction, sociologists call this a "waithood" - a state of tenuous social status, inability to gather enough resources to gain economic independence, "I can't make the transition into an adult!" - moreover, with frequent economic set-backs, little economic stability could be found in young people of these societies, with no hope of making the transition, many resorted to criminal activities. In all, youth of average households (therefore limited social connections or patronage relationships) were largely stuck in a cycle of poverty.

This generation is also known as the "hippo generation", a direct criticism to governments employed with older officials with little intention to change current situations or interest in the welfare of this younger crowd - either through civil protest or artistic creations: art and music, especially hip-hop.
