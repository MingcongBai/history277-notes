The African Disaspora (Guest: Philip Janzen)

*Hi sir...*

### Modern African Diaspora: Atlantic Slave Trade

As we have discussed in the last lecture, our question today is the concept of social death involved with the slave trades.

#### Social Death?

Slavery is *"the permanent, violent domination of natally alienated and generally dishonoured persons.".*

â€” Orlando Patterson

Lost of identity as a full person, the disconnection from kinship and community, and a barrier (a great difficulty) to recover as a full person again. Also, the lost of language, culture, and character - all those consistutes a full person.

Two concentrate the points...

- Absence of meaningful links to the past.
- Liminal, and marginalised position.

They have also lost of their property of being a living person. Treated as commodities, they were boiled down to a set of equations concerning profits - rubbed with oil and polished - so they could be sold at a higher price point.

*Did Africans suffer "social death" when they were loaded onto ships and carried to the Americas?*

No, at least, at the most part.

The keyword here is "death", a state where no one shall recover - at least not by natural means - the violent robbery of identity and honour resulted in such death. But it is also important not to ignore the implications of the lucrative market, those traders who would bring back the fugitive slaves for a reward given by the Europeans, and those cases when oppression were implied by the Europeans that renders them as commodities. Moreover, it is the combination of physical and social violence that brought by this death.

On the other hand, the re-union as communities - to an extent - rebuilt the identities of the African slaves as a person, the death is not a complete death. So to speak.

#### The Slave Ship of Emilia

The slave ship of Emilia reached Brazil, with 37 slaves died during the transport. By colonial rules, they were made into apprenticeship for 14 months (granted, they were treated with no difference to those enslaved). They were then kept in warehouses, where in some cases, couples married in them. After then, they began to work in urban Rio, working in sectors of heavy carriages, street light repairs, etc.

Slaves petitioned to be freed early. One of the slaves' master died, and thus gained freedom - and was able to gather fortune and materials - buying a ship, and was joined by 67 of his own shipments, returning to West Africa. They formed close bonds to each other since their arrival to Brazil. Slaves bought and sold in the trades often found themselves in new social bonds, *defying social death*.

#### Saint-Domingue (Haiti)

Like most places in the Americas, African slaves and their family descents form the majority of the population on the islands and mainlands - complimented by their owners and masters. Most of the slaves came from West-Central Africa, then the Kingdom of Kongo.

A French-Kikongo dictionary was even compiled in the wake of the Haiti Revolution (which brought establishment to the Republic of Kongo in 1804). A notion of maintained language usage in Saint-Domingue (their destination), a social bond was formed with their common cultural background. One may find the translations found in this dictionary displays great understanding of the language of Kikongo - in relation to French.

With social bond formed, those arrived at Saint-Domingue in later events saw themselves less and less as slaves, but much rather, as those lost kinship.

#### Calundu

From the Kimbundu word "kilundu" which means ancestor. Calundu was a healing practice from Central Africa, consisting of dancing, playing music, drinking, spirit possession, divination, and healing. With the great concentration of Central African population in Brazil, these practices were still frequently found in Brazil.

However, with the outlaw of witchcraft practices, those caught performing Calundu were often brought in, some were punished with death. Especially when plantation (slave) owners started using slaves to heal themselves with Calundu - it began to be seen as a potential threat to white colonial power.

#### What do these cases tell us?

Language and cultural values not only survived the middle passage, but thrived. Those who were transported thousands of miles away were far from socially dead - new communities, and new bonds brought new hope and values to those who suffered along this passage.
