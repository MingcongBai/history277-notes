Functions of Marriage
--------------------

### Survival of Lineages

The idea of lineage in Africa usually stands for a single thread in an extensive segmented political system - and marriage is seemed as a continuation of lineage - a person's identity is provided by their parents, and the identity of themselves could only be remembered by producing children to continue their lineages. In Africa, the most important aspect of the honour of a person is their lineage, and that one is not separated from the past (social death, slavery...).

### Child-Raising

In Africa, someone who does not have a child is considered with pity - for no one shall remember them after their death - and no continuation of life in a society. Children were considered to be afterlives of those passed away. Like in anywhere else in the world, children are the centers of marriages.

*Not that people did not have a choice, but choices were made with extra contexts - in social and political implications.* Having children is a demand by most African adults. Infertility could be regarded a pity - and it could become a basis of divorce - however, children could be gifted to that individual as their own child - so that their own lineage may survive. Parents **are those who raised a child**.

### Economics

Marriage may also be considered as economic advantage. As it is elsewhere, family is an economic concept, but some are not as explicit as those in Africa. Members of different ages has different tasks, as it is with women - who held different duties.

### Polygyny

A custom which allows a male to have multiple wives, and this could be explained that marriage could be saw as an economical engine to provide for the lineage - a wealth in people. More wives, more children, more work force for the family. In some cases, polygamy and polyandry may take place for roughly the same reasons.

Moreover, these practices are still considered as a norm - or still partially practiced - less so in urban areas.
