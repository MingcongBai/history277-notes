Popular Swahili Fiction in Socialist Tanzania
---------------------------------------------

### Dar es Salaam

Capital city which grown exponentially since the independence of Tanzania... As opposed to "traditional" city development via industrialization - a story in which tells of the improvement of quality of life, and cumulation of wealth - though the Tanzanian government called for such a process, rapid urbanization was coupled with a lack of income increase and lagging infrastructure development by the government...

... A similar story as seen in other cities in the global south.

What is the urban experience in such area, or specifically, as a young person in such a city? What does it mean to be urban? For this purpose, a good place to start would be looking at "Pulp" fiction found since 1970s in Africa. These books were often found to be in ~100 pages in length, with thinner paper for affordability - also found to be "trashy" by scholars, as intended for popular majority (woah wait...).

What might these books tell?

- Hopes of the author, fantasy, aspiration.
- Reflection of current circumstances, social commentaries.
- Critique of living environments and personal circumstances.

### Independence

Tanzania gained independence from Great Britain in 1961, and its first President remained in position until 1985. He pushed for a form of African socialism named "familyhood" - as opposed to radical socialist/communist ideals - an arguably original expression, which demanded populations to migrate and cluster in collective farms, participating in local affairs and politics. The program was very much anti-urban, as it believed that cities were creations of colonialism - unemployed individuals were rounded up by police and sent back to rural areas.

It is difficult to judge the program just by taking a look at individual aspects of the program... However, there is little doubt on the economic devastation brought by the program.

### Urbanization

Despite the effort to emphasize countrysides, there were unprecedented waves of migration into urban areas for education and employment opportunities. As people reached the urban areas, there were realizations of economic incompetency, population vastly overwhelming housing and employment capacity - a large portion were forced into informal sectors, even when people could get themselves into formal wage-earning occupations, by the end of "familyhood", value of wages dropped by ~83%.

- The urban scene, similar to urban areas elsewhere, saw great cultural and intellectual prosperity. At the same time, black markets thrived in urban areas: second-hand clothing, records, publications...
- Gender composition also shifted significatly in the periods of urban migration, as in colonial times, men overwhelmed women in population. However, in the early independent years, women composited the majority of migrants into urban areas.

The government on the other hand vilified young people who migrated to the urban, and blamed the issues of the nation on these people: in regard to their practices and cultural representations. The surveillance and criminalization of urban youth shaped the experience of living in the urban areas: unpatriotic, "hooligan", ...

### Literacy

Massive investments were set in by the government to increase literacy rates, by recruiting teachers to travel to countryside and teach reading and writing to residents. Great progress was observed in the first decade since independence, as suggested by UNESCO statistics. Education, of course, encouraged the integration of governmental ideals... Anti-urban. However, education also coupled with personal hygene, independence history, racial struggles... Despite the effort by the government, the books were not particularly popular among the youth - with their own aspiration for the future.

### Fictional Publications

Youth's book publication relied on international publishers, however, with the border deals collapsing between Tanzania and neighbouring countries, youths relied on publishing their own books in amateur sites: under the sign of religious publication, "side lines" of pulp fictions were printed and sold in suitcases...

It was often criticized by international scholars and the government itself that the books were severly limited in quality and relied largely on imitations... However, as we could see in the examples, these fictional publications adapted themselves into the context of Tanzania, and occassionally carried out social commentaries and satires. Moreover, they attributed their books (or even dedicating to) freedom fighters of the country - without ignoring the criticism to those in power.

All that said, the publication of these books relied on social relationships. For instance, typing up manuscripts - which they usually wrote in gatherings - required finding connections to office workers, and printing of these books - as mentioned above - required connections to a printing institution, many of which religious institutes protected by the government. However, book publications were usually in risk of copyright infringements, as the copies were sent to third parties for printing or retail agencies, with little contracts on the treatment of these intellectual properties...

Books were usually in high demand, a batch of 10,000 books could be sold out within one month. This number has limited insight to the true demand of these books, as books were shared and passed hand-to-hand, it is virtually impossible to comprehend the literature demand in Tanzanian societies... Moreover, authors often times did not wrote for profit, but much rather, for fame and recognition within the urban social networks.

Thus, it could be reasonably concluded that these publications constructed the urban culture.

### War and Desperation

In the late 1970s, as war broke out between Tanzania and Uganda, economic gone into a more difficult position - and with the lack of effort or ability by the government to provide survival necesities - black market became the main economy in Tanzania, making it easier to buy a book of fiction than toothpaste and tea...

### The End

... Socialism ended in Tanzania in the 1980s... However, these kind of publication was almost uniquely found in Tanzania - with appropriate context (and therefore materials) - declined with import of books and movies, with the opening of international markets. Followed with the end of socialism in Tanzania was unfortunately a drop in literacy rate.

Another thing worth looking at is the nature of these publications and their authors, their rebellious character allowed them to revisionise the urban scene through their own lens. The appeals of these publications then became the mainstream and official character of the society, and thus loosing their novelty with the removal of socialism protection in Tanzania.
