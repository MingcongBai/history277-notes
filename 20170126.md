Geography and African Environment
---------------------------------

### Two preliminary points

- Geography provides foundational knowledge about any place. Knowledge of Africa especially is conditioned by bio-geography and physical/environmental geography. (\*)
- Despite rapid urbanization, about half of all Africans live in rural areas and many still take their living directly from land. This lecture will focus on how African environments set conditions for people's productive activities farming. (\*\*)

(\*) Take an example: a comer to the United States might notice that there is a strong distrust of the Federal Government, especially in the Western states - a massive amount of land in the Western United States is owned and regulated by the Federal Government. People in the states like Utah and Colorado would rather own their own land, rather than being owned and restricted access to by the government. One may ask that why did the government own the land in the first place, and without much resistance? The land there was too dry and therefore unsuitable for farming - consider this in the context of late 18th century. Not only to the question of land, culture, especially in the department of literature of the Western states would reflect geographical reality of this locale. That said, it is essential to have a basic idea of the geographical facts of this locale to be able to comprehend such products of culture.

(\*\*) In the question of African life style, Africa is still the most rural continent in the world. Rapid Urbanization in Africa has dropped its farming population from roughly 70% to 50%. But still, those living in the new cities in Africa are, at most 2 generations removed from the rural lives - their grandparents may well be farmers still, living off the land - and most of them should still have knowledge of the land and the farming lives (of the other half Africans).

### The physical landscape

Much of Africa is a gently plateau - much like Texas, the scale is great, and the variations are subtle. The main exception of this feature is in the Eastern - and bit to the South - of the continent:

- Tectonic activity, ancient volcanism and the montains of the region.
- Rift valleys that also developed from the tectonic activities, forming great lakes in the middle of such features (South of Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, and Mozambique).
- Mountainous areas are also found outside of this region of the African continent (Nigeria, for example).

### Soils

Most of the good soils in Africa could be found in the East and Southern regions, with great amount of volcanism, those soil derived from the volcanic rocks contained great amount of minerals - ideal for plantation/production. Human has generally thrived in regions of such features. Population concentrations in Africa, of course, are found near these areas.

In the rest of Africa, however, the question of soil was quite challenging. Three aspects of the African soil challenge are worth noting:

- Apart from the Nile Delta (which is in a desert, therefore only farmed in flood periods of a year), Africa lacks great, fertile delta regions. Such as are common in East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and South America. Rivers carrying soil, sand, rock, and of course, dead plants and animals slowed down at the delta regions, forming a great repository of nutrients in the soils. Also worth noting was that rivers, while flowing through dry regions slows down, dropping nutrient agents at those region, instead of driving them all the way to the delta (and to the seas) - rivers slowing down also challenged the formation of delta regions - not to mention that due to the ocean currents in the Atlantics, delta matters (just putting it that way) were driven away immediately (relatively).
- In humid tropical Africa, organic matter (a critical component of most good soils) doesn't stay in the soil where farmers need it to be. Ecosystem metabolism is so rapid that essential nutrients contained in organic matter are rapidly cycled from the ground up through roots and back up into the trees. Cutting down and burning trees can free nutrients, but rainfall is so heavy that soils unprotected by vegetation would be washed away. In other words, nutrients were commonly found in human tropicals, but not much was freely available in the soils.
- In the parts of Africa where rainfall is highly seasonal (where there's a wet season but also a long, hot dry season), consisting of much of Africa - soil development is therefore hampered by a lack of organic matter and also by the baking and chemical hardening ([laterite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laterite) crusts) of the ground that happens under a beating sun.

But note that the soil situation did *not* make agriculture in Africa impossible, it is important to know that African agriculture has a longer history than virtually anywhere else in the world. It is *dangerously incorrect* to put the blame of African's poverty on the matter of soil, the reasons are clearly found elsewhere.

### Climate

Stereotypes of the climate in Africa is virtually always "hot year round" - which is not a bad one. The equator of the Earth crosses through the center of Africa. But *there are exceptions to this dominate feature*.

A good example would be Africa north to the Sahara Desert, along the coast line of Mediterranean Sea - region that has cool winter - almost identical to the climate at South Spain, Italy, and Greece. Southern African nations, has climates roughly alike for obvious reasons...

*"... If it's not obvious, look it up!"*

Snowfall is sometimes found in these regions.

#### Minor exception - the desert

In the Sahara desert, due to the lack of water (for water's high heat capacity, inhibiting the change in temperature given a set amount of heat), there is a great diurnal (having a daily cycle) temperature fluctuation.

#### Rainfall zones

There are four distinct rainfall zones in tropical Africa:

- Humid tropics (rainy nearly year-round).
- Sub-humid tropics (rainy season lasts 6-10 months).
- Semi-arid tropics (rainy season lasts 2-6 months).
- Dry/Arid tropics (very little rain).

See a climate and a biome map for identification - note the correlation between climate and types of biomes found in specific regions. For example, in *savanna* biomes found in sub-humid and (very little) semi-arid tropics, the more the rain, the more and bigger the trees (and in semi-arid tropics, savannah became a *shrub savanna* - corresponding to the usual observations).
