African Economies
-----------------

It is not until recently that the development of African economies (or the failure of it in many cases) were talked extensively in class. For the purpose of this lecture, we will be looking at the World Bank, International Agricultural Development, charity programmes... And various development agencies implemented by most richer countries - and of course, its effect on African economic development. Not to be left out is the African's own development agencies and planning institutes.

On the contrary, it is very important to look into political corruption, lack of trained labourers, and the lack of environmental regulation in the African countries. However, times has changed, that people around the world could expect extensive economic growth, and gradually more independent developments by African themselves.

### On the Poverty of Africa (Material)

The lack of material goods and economic safety is still prevalent in African countries - associated with lack of education, and consequently, the lack of ability to provide education. No one, with some exceptions in religious faiths, wanted material poverty - no one wanted their children to go to bed hungry, to settle for physical labour for the lack of education.

#### GDP

The classic measurement of wealth for countries as a whole is via GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita - **not income per capita**. GDP is the estimated total dollar-value of all service and product produced in a country's economy in a year. GDP per capita is then a measurement of (on average) a person's production in a year.

Taking a look at Africa, for all countries in Africa combined, GDP per capita was 3,330 dollars. The richest country, Qatar, GDP per capita was 101,000 dollars - followed by Lichtstein, and United States, 15th richest, 52,800 dollars. The three poorest, Somalia, 600 dollars; Zimbabwe, 600 dollars; Democratic Republic of the Congo, 400 dollars.

Mineral rich countries in Africa, however... Mostly mineral rich, has GDP of 1,600 - 2,000 dollars.

**Again, nothing to do with income**. If Africa was a country, it will rank 175th by last year's data.

#### Dollar-A-Day Threshold

Calculated by person, as much as one could buy with 1 U.S. Dollar, in the United States. Some of the poorest countries in Africa are below in this line. What percent of people in a country lives below this line?

- None in the United States and Canada, for providence of welfare programmes.
- In Latin America, ~6.5% of population lives below this line.
- In East Asia and Pacific, ~10%.
- In South Asia (India, etc.), ~33%.
- In Sub-Saharan Africa, ~47%.

#### So What?

What is demonstrated here is that Africa is in fact, in both regard of production and purchasing power, is the poorest continent of all.

### Hope for Growth

In the early 1960s, a great deal of hope was put upon Africa for exponential economical growth - a general thought by international observers and economists - however, a mere assumption. Some countries, in contrary, were in better shape before their independence. The optimistic was short lived, virtually none observed economic growth, some even experienced *negative* growth...

#### Explanations?

For instance, blaming the colonisers...

- Infrastructures left for African countries were unsuitable for independent countries with little interaction with European countries - agricultural and mineral alike. A lack of manufacturing base left African countries in bad shape.
- Minimal transportation framework, unsuitably designed for economical development - i.e., train tracks were built to go from inland to the coast for exportation, but little infrastructures were provided for internal (African) trades - a difficult position for neighbouring trades.
- Lack of trained personnel for economical management and regulation...

On the other hand, in the question of production...

- African countries produced largely raw materials, the relative purchasing cost for raw materials were declining fast by the 60s. Adding onto lack of manufacturers for added value... And the climbing purchasing cost of final products...

Moreover, the will to gain independence from old "masters", and to avoid "neo-colonial" targets...

- Discouraged by the government of foreign investment - mostly an ideological measure by the time - excluding investors and richer bodies of manufacturing. Money did not flow, neither did they have the money for facilitate movement.
- Colonialism discouraged a generation or two of Africans, leading to the lack of confidence and a self inferior complex - and thus the lack of hope - people could not convince themselves to bring active growth to the society.

It is also argued that the language diversity in Africa could have had a negative impact with international conversation and collaboration in Africa (the lecturer does not agree) - it could be argued, however, that with basic fluency in English and French, basic conversation could be initiated despite the ~3,000 languages found in Africa.

(What's more...) Governmental flaws, and international aid's fiasco due to the lack of knowledge on circumstances and reality - or generally lack of consideration - for long term maintenance and other potential issues that led to self-destruction of these plans.

### African's Economical growth

African economy, as measured in 2016 and 2017 so far, has been growing faster than *any* other parts of the world. The standard way of measuring a country's economical growth is by looking at the delta of GDP... **On average, African's GDP has been growing in the past decade at 5.6% per year** - despite certain fluctuations found depending on time and data sources.

The top growth countries in Africa in the last year, Ethiopia, 9.6%; Ivory Coast, 9.2%... On the other hand, Sierra Leone, shrinked by 22% last year. In the United States, it was slightly over 2.6% for 2016, 2.5% for Mexico, 2.2% for the U.K..

With 5.6% rate sustained, by 2025, most African countries could grow to middle income status, which is 1,000 dollars per year in GDP.

#### Why now? Why not earlier?

In the lecturer's opinion, the growth of today was set in stage in late 90s, the World Bank and other international banks were shamed for allowing debts to African countries, making it impossible for the countries to pay off of the loans. The debts taken by African countries were forgiven by these institutes. This little bit of generosity was critical to African countries, allowing for **independent planning on development**.

On the other hand, new trade partners were made over the past two decades. China, India, the United States, and the European Union were the major players in the investment - China accounts for 12.5% of exports in Africa, by private companies regulated by the Chinese government, in partnership with African entrepeneurs. The involvement of Chinese companies are controversial, with concerns regarding corruption, labour treatment, and environmental regulations.

#### Improved political stability

More democracy in various forms, less autocratic rulings, and less abrupt political changes - investors were, and are attracted by political stability and relative peace - however, exceptions do exist.

#### Cheap labour
